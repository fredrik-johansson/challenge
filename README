CAS Challenge
=============

This is a mathematical coding challenge.

The idea is to implement mathematical operations following a strict set of rules:

* No implementation of an algorithm may consume more than 30 lines (excluding comment and blank lines, which are not counted).

* No two algorithms for computing the same mathematical operation may have the same complexity.

* An additional top-level function which selects between various algorithms for a given operation may be present, but must also not exceed 40 lines.

* All functions must implement recognised mathematical operations and be generally useful.

* No line of code should contain more than one complete C statement.

* No line of code may exceed 80 characters.

* All code should be readable, commented and well spaced out (remember blank and comment lines are not counted in the total).

* Macros of up to 7 lines are allowed, but must be generally useful.

* All non-generic code must be implemented in pure C with no external libraries.

* Each C module may have a C++ class and wrapper associated with it. There is no limit on the size of the class declaration.

* All generic algorithms should be implemented in C++.
